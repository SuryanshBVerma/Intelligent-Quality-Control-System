## System Overview

This quality control system integrates:
- **Production Machines**: The physical equipment being monitored
- **Data Sources**: Sensors and vision systems collecting operational data
- **Quality Control System**: Central processing unit for defect detection
- **Operators**: Human personnel receiving alerts and signals
- **Admin**: System administrators managing configurations

## Key Components and Data Flows

### 1. External Entities

1. **Production Machines**:
   - Source of operational data
   - Receives control signals from the system
   - Physical equipment being monitored

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Combination of IoT sensors and vision systems
   - Collects both sensor measurements and visual data
   - Continuously streams raw operational data

3. **Operators**:
   - Primary users of the system
   - Receive real-time alerts and signals
   - Make decisions based on system outputs

4. **Admin**:
   - System administrators
   - Configure parameters and thresholds
   - Manage user access and system settings

### 2. Quality Control System (Central Process)

The main processing unit that:
- Receives raw sensor and vision data
- Processes and analyzes the data streams
- Generates quality assessments
- Produces outputs including:
  - Alerts for operators
  - Control signals for machines
  - Processed data for storage/analysis

### 3. Data Flows

1. **Input Flows**:
   - **Sensor and Vision Data**: Raw operational data from production machines
     - Continuous streams of measurements
     - Real-time image/video feeds

2. **Output Flows**:
   - **Alerts and Signals**: To operators
     - Visual/audible notifications
     - Priority-based alerts
   - **Control Signals**: To production machines
     - Adjustment commands
     - Emergency stop signals
   - **Processed Data**: To storage systems
     - Quality metrics
     - Processed images
     - Anomaly reports

## System Characteristics

1. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Continuous data collection
   - Immediate processing
   - Low-latency alerts

2. **Multi-modal Data Integration**:
   - Combines sensor measurements with visual inspection
   - Correlates different data types for comprehensive analysis

3. **Closed-loop Control**:
   - Automated machine adjustments
   - Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

## Typical Workflow

1. Data Collection:
   - Sensors capture operational parameters (temperature, vibration, etc.)
   - Vision systems capture product/machine images

2. Data Processing:
   - Raw data is cleaned and normalized
   - AI models analyze for defects/anomalies
   - Quality metrics are calculated

3. Output Generation:
   - Normal operation: Data logged for historical analysis
   - Abnormal operation: Alerts generated
   - Critical faults: Machine signals sent

4. Human Interaction:
   - Operators respond to alerts
   - Admins adjust system parameters
